  a. Given two-dimensional pattern sample sets  
  b. Using perceptron learning algorithm with fixed increment methods to find the interface equation  
  c. plot it    
2. Eigenface (PCA):  
  a. Based on Principal Component Analysis  
  b. Using Eigenface algorithm to train the samples in the training set and perform face recognition tests    
3. K-Means:  
  a. Compare the clustering effect  
  b. understand advantages and disadvantages of K-Means algorithm
